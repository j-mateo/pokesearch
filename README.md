# PokeSearch
### Searching Pokemons
Pokemons can be searched by name or id by typing in the search bar and tapping the enter key

### Search suggestions
Search suggestions are displayed after entering two characters or more.
The suggestions are pokemons that we have already "seen" while scrolling down the main page, so not all
pokemons will show up in suggestions at first.

A possible improvement would be to get the complete list of pokemon names and caching that list for later use.
